Waifu Stocks
  S1:
    Setup DB (see whiteboard for schema)
    Move over WIP code from earlier, check it works, make commands that call these and pass discord ids
    sellToMarket (sells a girl to the market for 0.9x her current listed price, market has internal value from the lost 10% which is distributed evenly next update to all girls for "market inflation" over time)
    dailyUpdate (does the trades vs par value shift algorithm I came up with on the whiteboard, with a minor amount of rng to simulate market uncertainty)
    elo boosts (when a ;set is recorded, the waifus the winning player has at least 1 stock gain a small boost to the next dailyUpdate)
  S2:
    insertGirl (make it a command, takes Name, Series, Description, PictureURL, all are \n delimited)
    profile (refactor with smash profile, so it shows both things)
    wallet (just shows wallet, not full profile)
  S3:
    command to see player's catalogue of girls
    command to see market's catalogue of girls
    command to see an individual girl by name
  S4:
    add reaction button to verify buying from a player (seller has to click reaction)
    work on concurrency stuff (lock a gID while doing things to that stock, if a request comes in and hits a locked gID it waits, whenever a request finishes it tells queue to pop and check if the next is a request for a still locked gID, if it is it puts it to the back of the queue and checks the next one, until it reaches a gID that isn't locked)
